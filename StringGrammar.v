(** Now, specialize the previous CFGV to
  CFGVs where the symbols are denoted by strings.
  The goal is to make the specification
  of a [StringCFGV] to be as close as that to 
  paper-pen presentations, i.e. the user has to
  specify the minimal amount of information ans
  proofs are filled automatically.
  We have a decision procedure that takes a [StringCFGV]
  and either produces [CFGV] or produces a proof that
  something is wrong with the input*)

(** We can now use coq's definitional equality to 
    check the properties required to get a [CFGV]
    from [StringCFGV]. The idea is that

    the proof of the predicate below should
    just be a tuple of [eq_refl].*)
